// Create a base class called Vehicle with properties like make (string) and year (int), and a method displayInfo() to show these details.

// Then, create two derived classes:

// Car with an additional property numDoors (int) 
// and a method displayCarInfo() that displays the vehicle’s basic information along with the number of doors.
// Motorcycle with an additional property hasSidecar (bool) 
// and a method displayMotorcycleInfo() that displays the vehicle’s basic information along with whether it has a sidecar.
// In main(), create objects of Car and Motorcycle, set their properties, and display their information.
